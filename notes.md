I decided to remove questions that I wasn't using in my personal notes, as all of the monuments I was studying came from the same site. So location, name and such were all known without filling in the form.

While going through the tutorial to setup R with jupyter I got alot of errors trying to set up. Eventually I got all green lights from the [[r_kernel_install.ipynb]] but when I proceeded to [[r-for-gis.ipynb]] R got stuck connecting and never worked. I will continue my troubleshooting going forward. Hoping to fix and catch up on everything over the thanksgiving break.
